User Story 1: I (the end-user) hold a rope in my hand. I ask the device holding the software, “How do I make this rope into a monkey knot”? The device then gives you a tutorial on how to do it. 

User Story 2: I am the owner of a company who provides contracting services in the trades industry, and I want to more quickly spin up new employees on basic hand-tool use. 

User Story 3: I am a digital content creator who focuses on tutorials, and I want to produce content for my audience that more accurately reflects the problem they are trying to solve.
